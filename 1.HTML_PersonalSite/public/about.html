  Before I Before I entered university, I started studying computer science.<br />
  Now, I have completed J.P Morgan Chase Virtual Intern on Forage in May 2024 as an extracurricular experience.<br />
  During this time, I learned valuable knowledge, I learned how to use git and Github,<br />
  set up a local dev environment by downloading the necessary files, tools and dependencies,<br />
  fixed broken files in the repository to make web application output correctly,<br />
  used JPMorgan Chaseâ€™s open source library called Perspective to generate a live graph that displays a data feed in a clear and visually appealing way for traders to monitor.<br />

  I hope that in my future college life, I can acquire more valuable work experience,<br />
  and make my dream of becoming a software engineer come true.<br />
